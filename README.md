# Class13LabB

Class Lab 13B on Polymorphism and Inheritance

Add a class named "Barn" that implements Structure.  The Barn constructor should accept a number of stalls and square feet. The Barn toString method should return a String that displays the number of stalls and the word Barn (i.e., "5 stalled Barn"). 

Modify the main method to store House and Barn objects in the existing ArrayList, add 2 barns to the list, and display all 4 structures to the console.
